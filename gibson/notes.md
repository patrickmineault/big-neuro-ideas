# Chapters 1, 2 and 3

## Some threads that we discussed

* Is there a line to be seen that goes Konrad Lorenz -> Gibson -> Paul Cisek
* What is Gibson reacting against? What was vision research back then? Those were the days of peak-Movhson, perhaps.
* Is this book about how animals and environments co-develop? Or is the idea underlying this idea there, but this book specialized to humans?
* There's a fundamental tension in the book: a generative model of visual information is posited (surfaces, BDRFs), but it's implicitly assumed (perhaps?) that the animal can perform its actions without an internal model.
* What does 85% of V1 do? 
* Do we even know what attention is (William James: we all know what it is...)
* There's an underlying thread of compositionality: objects are made of stuff made of things. How does this break down?
* Kant vs. Hume: [obligatory Existential comic](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/39)
* Affordances in design of UIs vs. Gibson view: human as an agent (or robot)
* Inductive biases in genes
* Animals only care about a couple of orders of magnitude of space and time (unless they plan and encode complex memories!)
* There's a natural progression during development: first come border cells, then place cells, and finally grid cells
* Catching a ball via a heuristic (or doing a high five elbow-to-elbow)

## Threads we discussed

## The ambient optic array

Given a point of observation at some position, the arrangement (heterogeneous structure) of surfaces as conveyed by ambient light in the medium completely surrounding that point.Observer can be inside ambient optic array, but isn’t strictly necessary. When a position is occupied, it now contains information about the body of the observer. This changes the space! Differentiates this framework from perspective in geometry.

The point of observation in ecological optics is never stationary except as a limiting case.

## Optic flow

* Gibson was important for the idea of “optic flow”: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow)

* Spiders move their heads to use parallax as a cue: [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6067/469](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6067/469)

* Some note on optic flow: [http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/%7Elanger/558/2-translation-slides.pdf](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/%7Elanger/558/2-translation-slides.pdf)

* Bees and optic flow: [https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/218/7/1051.full.pdf](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/218/7/1051.full.pdf) 

* Optic flow (flowing perspective structure) specifies any particular path of locomotion.

## Invariants and occlusion

Although a rectangular surface (e.g., a table) may appear like a trapezoid from a given perspective, you perceive the invariant rectangular shape given different points of observation.

Flowing perspective structure and invariances in structure are coupled.

We perceive whole objects even when they’re occluded by other objects; occluded objects are only temporarily out of sight, so locomotion can resolve uncertainty associated with occlusion (reversibility of occlusion).

“The moving observer and the moving sun are conditions under which terrestrial vision has evolved for millions of years.”

# Chapter 6

Events are not time…

Three kinds of (TERRESTRIAL) events

1. change in layout of surfaces
2. change in color and texture of surfaces
3. change in the existence of surfaces

Events are nested.

Change (over time) as a general concept,

What is common between what happens in the real world and what happens in the optic array?

* sequences of events (?)
* temporal synchrony

flash lag experiments

What would Gibson think of Edelman’s concept of representation?

* internal representations of the world are linked to external events in the world

but Gibson seems to argue that there is no 1-to-1 mapping between state of the world and internal states

however the final outcome (action in the world) might still be valid

Russ Poldrack: do neuroscience and machine learning concepts of representation satisfy philosophical criteria for “representations”?

Gibsonian sense of representation: they just need to encode information about the world even if they do not match “THE REAL WORLD” (whatever that is)

Events define time. There is no arrow of time. Nice link with recent cog neuro experiments on boundaries of events.

This chapter feels human-centered. It’s unclear if all animals, for example, would care about all the changes that are described in chapter 6.

Value of classification: “things that happen on a Tuesday” (does the ability to classify something mean that the class is real (?))

What about water? changes in water, are they events?

Events and time are defined by the sensory systems the animal possesses
