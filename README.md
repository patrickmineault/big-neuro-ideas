# Big neuro ideas

An ongoing journal club for the study of big ideas in neuroscience. 

# What are reading right now?

We're reading [Gibson, an ecological approach to perception (1968)](https://archive.org/details/pdfy-u5hmFOvOM2Civ4Gz/mode/2up). Notes so far:

* [Week 1: Chapters 1, 2, 3](gibson/notes.md)
* [Week 2: Chapters 3, 4](gibson/notes.md#chapters-3-and-4)
* [Week 3: Chapter 5](gibson/notes.md#chapter-5)
* [Week 4: Chapter 6](gibson/notes.md#chapter-6)


## What's a *big idea*?

An idea that tries to unify a bunch of disparate observations about the brain, with a theoretical slant. Preferably with an explanatory bent rather than phenomenological, with an emphasis on theory. We prefer books and articles that have withstood the test of time (i.e. 10 years or older). Sometimes a big idea can just be about asking the right question, not solving it.
